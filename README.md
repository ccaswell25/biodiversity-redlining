# Analyzing Historically Redlined Neighborhoods and Bird Biodiversity

## Purpose

I am going to investigate the legacy of redlining in current environmental (in)justice. This is important because a recent study found that redlining has not only affected the environments communities are exposed to, it has also shaped our observations of biodiversity.[^readme-1]

[^readme-1]: Ellis-Soto, D., Chapman, M., & Locke, D. H. (2023). Historical redlining is associated with increasing geographical disparities in bird biodiversity sampling in the United States. \^Nature Human Behaviour, 1-9.

## Set-up

Data associated with this analysis is too large to be included in the repository. It was downloaded and stored locally and included in the .gitignore. You can find details on the data files included in the R markdown file.
